## Hiya, I'm Alicia ðŸ‘©

I'm a Junior Full Stack Software Developer with a mix of technical know-how and strong people skills, thanks to my diverse work experience across different industries. 
<br/>
I love bringing fresh perspectives to every role I take on. Whether itâ€™s diving into a new course, exploring a hobby, or taking on something that pushes me outside my comfort zone, Iâ€™m always looking to grow and challenge myself.

Based in Auckland, New Zealand ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿
